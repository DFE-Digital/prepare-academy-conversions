# Prepare academy conversions service
Internal service for managing applications for schools to become academies.

## Requirements
- .NET 8.0
- NodeJS 21 (for frontend build tools)

## Development Setup

- Run `npm install; npm run build` from the `Dfe.PrepareConversions/wwwroot` directory to build the styles.
- Run `dotnet restore` from the `Dfe.PrepareConversions` project to restore dependencies.
- Run `dotnet run` from the `Dfe.PrepareConversions` project to run the application.

### User-secrets
The following user secrets are required to be able to connect to the TRAMS API (also known as the Academies API):

- `TramsApi:ApiKey` - The API key for the TRAMS API.
- `TramsApi:Endpoint` - The base URL for the TRAMS API.
- `AcademisationApi:ApiKey` - The API key for the Academisation API.
- `AcademisationApi:BaseUrl` - The base URL for the Academisation API.

The following user secret is required for the landing page to be able to navigate to the Transfers service:

- `ServiceLink:TransfersUrl` - The URL for the Transfers service.

For local development, user secrets can be set using the command:
- `dotnet user-secrets set "key" "value"` from the `Dfe.PrepareConversions` project.

Alternatively, there is a Rider plugin called `.NET Core User Secrets` that allows the secrets to be managed via a json file, accessed by right clicking on the project -> `Tools` -> `Open Project User Secrets`.

## Cypress testing

Install cypress and dependencies:
- Run 'npm install' from the Dfe.PrepareConversions.CypressTests directory

### Test execution

To execute the tests locally and view the output, you will need to set environment variables. Create a new file named `cypress.env.json` in the project root with the following content:

```json
{
   "url": "BASE_URL_OF_APP",
   "cypressTestSecret": "<SECRET HERE>",
   "academisationApiUrl": "<SECRET HERE>",
   "academisationApiKey": "<SECRET HERE>"
}
```

Please make sure to replace `<SECRET HERE>` with the actual secret values in the `cypress.env.json` file before running the tests.

### Open the Cypress Test Runner for interactive testing
`npx cypress open`

### Run the Cypress tests in headless or headed modes

```
npm run cy:run -headless
```

or

```
npm run cy:open -headed
```

### Useful tips

#### Maintaining sessions
Each 'it' block usually runs the test with a clear cache. For our purposes, we may need to maintain the user session to test various scenarios. This can be achieved by adding the following code to your tests:

```js
afterEach(() => {
   cy.storeSessionData();
});
```

##### Writing global commands
The cypress.json file in the `support` folder contains functions which can be used globally throughout your tests. Below is an example of a custom login command

```js
Cypress.Commands.add("login",()=> {
   cy.visit(Cypress.env('url')+"/login");
   cy.get("#username").type(Cypress.env('username'));
   cy.get("#password").type(Cypress.env('password')+"{enter}");
   cy.saveLocalStorage();
})
```

Which you can access in your tests like so:

```js
before(function () {
   cy.login();
});
```

#### Accessibility

**Basic usage**

By default, it will scan the whole page but it also can be configured to run against a specific element, or to exclude some elements.

```js
it('Has no detectable a11y violations on load', () => {
   // Test the page at initial load
   cy.checkA11y()
})
```

**Applying a context and run parameters**

```js
it('Has no detectable a11y violations on load (with custom parameters)', () => {
   // Test the page at initial load (with context and options)
   cy.checkA11y('.example-class', {
      runOnly: {
         type: 'tag',
         values: ['wcag2a']
      }
   })
})
```

##### Cypress Linting
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

Note: If you installed ESLint globally then you must also install eslint-plugin-cypress globally.

Installation using npm
`npm install eslint-plugin-cypress --save-dev`

Installation using yarn
`yarn add eslint-plugin-cypress --dev`

Usage: Add an .eslintrc.json file to your cypress directory with the following:

```json
{
   "plugins": [
      "cypress"
   ]
}
```

Add rules, example:

```json
{
   "rules": {
       "cypress/no-assigning-return-values": "error",
       "cypress/no-unnecessary-waiting": "error",
       "cypress/assertion-before-screenshot": "warn",
       "cypress/no-force": "warn",
       "cypress/no-async-tests": "error",
       "cypress/no-pause": "error"
   }
}
```

Use the recommended configuration and you can forego configuring plugins, rules, and env individually.
 
```json
{
   "extends": [
      "plugin:cypress/recommended"
   ]
}
```

### Security testing with ZAP

The Cypress tests can also be run, proxied via OWASP ZAP for passive security scanning of the application.

These can be run using the configured docker-compose.yml, which will spin up containers for the ZAP daemon and the Cypress tests, including all networking required. You will need to update any config in the file before running

Create a .env file for docker, this file needs to include

* all of your required cypress configuration
* HTTP_PROXY e.g. http://zap:8080
* ZAP_API_KEY, can be any random guid

Example env:

```dotenv
URL=<Enter URL>
API_KEY=<Enter API key>
HTTP_PROXY=http://zap:8080
ZAP_API_KEY=<Enter random guid>
```

_Note: You might have trouble running this locally because of docker thinking localhost is the container and not your machine_

To run docker compose use:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --exit-code-from cypress
```

_Note: `--exit-code-from cypress` tells the container to quit when cypress finishes_

You can also exclude URLs from being intercepted by using the NO_PROXY setting

e.g. `NO_PROXY=*.google.com,yahoo.co.uk`

Alternatively, you can run the Cypress tests against an existing ZAP proxy by setting the environment configuration

```dotenv
HTTP_PROXY="<zap-daemon-url>"
NO_PROXY="<list-of-urls-to-ignore>"
```

and setting the runtime variables

```
zapReport=true,zapApiKey=<zap-api-key>,zapUrl="<zap-daemon-url>"
```
